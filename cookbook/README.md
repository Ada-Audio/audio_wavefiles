Ada Wavefile Library: Cookbook
==============================

The [cookbook](cookbook.md) file contains a list of source-code examples for
various use-cases â€” starting from the simplest ones to more complicated
use-cases.

The cookbook file is written in Markdown syntax. You can create a PDF document
for it using `pandoc`. For example:

```sh
pandoc --highlight-style tango -o cookbook.pdf cookbook.md
```
