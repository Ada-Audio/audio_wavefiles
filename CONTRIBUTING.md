## Automatically generated source-code files

This project contains automatically generated source-code files. You can find
them in the `src.prep` directories. It is expected that changes intended for
automatically generated files are made in the templates from the `src.prep`
directories, not in the automatically generated files themselves. Also, a
continuous integration test verifies that those files are "in sync."

## Testing

Before creating a pull request to this project, please make sure that all tests
are passing. Pull requests with failing tests won't be considered for
integration.

This project makes use of continuous integration infrastructure from GitHub and
Travis-CI. You can verify the tests results using this infrastructure.

## Code of conduct

Although this project doesn't have an official code of conduct, it is expected
that behaviors such as using welcoming and inclusive language or being
respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences are observed.
