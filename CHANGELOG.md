        - Added function for guessing the channel configuration based on number
          of channels.

### PCM Buffer Features

- Removed support for operations on PCM buffers.
    - Removed support for common operations (`=`, `*`, `+`, `-`) and custom
      operations.
    - This feature might be re-introduced in the future using better design.

- Improved consistency of the terminology used in the API.
    - Clarified distinction between wavefile interfacing and PCM buffer:
        - The prefix `Wav` is used for features that refer to data from
          wavefiles, while
        - the prefix `PCM` is used for features that refer to the PCM buffer.
    - This includes terms such as `PCM_Sample` and `Wav_Sample` for the data
      type used for samples stored in PCM buffers and in wavefiles.

- Added support for reading and writing of wavefiles in floating-point format.
    - The Library now uses formal floating-point and fixed-point data types as
      parameters of the generic I/O packages.

- Improved maintainability of the Library by adding support for generated
  source-code files for fixed-point and floating-point targets.

- Improved conversion between PCM and wavefile data types.
    - Fixed issue affecting small negative values in the PCM data.
    - Fixed issue affecting 24-bit wavefiles.

- Added support for arbitrary channel ranges.
    - Added formal `Channel_Range` parameter to the generic `PCM_IO` / `Wav_IO`
      packages.

- Added procedural version of `Get` (for reading samples from a wavefile).

#### Testing

- Added test for generated source-code files to prevent *local* changes.

- Added test of data accuracy — including data I/O and data type conversion —
  by checking extreme values on following formats and bit depths:
    - 16/24/32/64-bit fixed-point data;
    - 32/64 floating-point data.

- Added tests for all source-code examples of the cookbook.
    - Added check of wavefile information (using `wavinfo` tool).
    - Added comparison check for standard output / error.
    - Added comparison check for wavefiles.
    - Reference logfiles and wavefiles are stored in the `cookbook/ref`
      directory.

- Introduced simple benchmarking environment for performance checks.
    - NOTE: reference benchmarks and benchmark history are not available.

- Added support for continuous integration (CI) testing using GitHub actions
  and Travis-CI.
    - Added all tests mentioned above to the CI scripts.
    - Extended compiler version and platform coverage by testing following
      configurations using GitHub Actions:
        - GNAT FSF 7, 8, 9, and 10 (on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04);
        - GNAT Community 2020 on Linux, Windows and macOS.

### Documentation

- Introduced cookbook with source-code examples for various use-cases,
  including the following use-cases:
    - Opening and closing of a wavefile for reading or writing.

    - Converting a 16-bit (fixed-point/integer) wavefile to a 32-bit
      floating-point wavefile.
    - Down-mixing of wavefiles for following use-cases:
        - stereo to mono wavefile;
        - 5.1-channel to stereo wavefile;
        - 7.1.4-channel to 5.1-channel wavefile.
    - Direct reading of data from a wavefile without PCM buffer conversion (for
      16-bit wavefile).
